title: PR reviews are underrated

I feel like PR reviews are such an underrated part of the software development process. I think many
people feel like they're a bit of an extra chore, something that often adds little value and just
distracts them from their more important work. I've even worked in organisations where we didn't do
PR reviews at all, and I've seen the consequences of that.

PRs are the primary way developers discuss, collaborate and learn from each other. They're something
you need to get right if you want to build a high-performing team.

I've personally always enjoyed doing PR reviews and commenting on other people's work, and have
actively made it a priority in my work. In this post, I'll try to go through how you can take PR
reviews from feeling like a chore to being something that you actually look forward to doing!

# But it takes me out of "the flow"

One of the most common complaints I hear when it comes to PR reviews is that it never feels like a
good time to stop what you're doing and switch to reviewing something (often) unrelated. I get it!

One of my key realisations over the past few years is that "the flow" is a bit of a myth. If you're
relying on some magical, uninterruptible flow state to get your work done, you're setting yourself
up for failure. The reality is that you're going to be interrupted, and you're going to have to
figure out how to get your work done even when you're constantly switching contexts.

So, what's the alternative? I think the key thing to embrace is to split your work into smaller
chunks. And I mean a lot smaller! If you're working on a feature that takes you a week to complete,
you should aim to split it into smaller chunks of work that take at most an hour or two to complete.
This means that every day, you're probably looking at putting out one or two PRs for others to
review.

With this kind of approach, you're forced to plan your work ahead of time. You can't just jump into
work and see where it takes you; you need to have a clear idea of what's a realistic scope to get
done in a day, before you begin. This is a good thing! It means you're less likely to get stuck in
random rabbit holes, and will ultimately find yourself being a LOT more productive.

Once you're in this kind of workflow, where every hour or two you're able to reach a "checkpoint" in
your progress towards a bigger objective, you'll find you suddenly have multiple opportunities
during the day to switch to reviewing someone else's code without losing focus on your own work.

# But I don't have anything to comment on

Yeah, there's sometimes PRs that are just so good that you don't have anything to say about them.
And in these rare cases, it's totally fine to just approve them and move on - you don't need to
force yourself to come up with something to say.

But these cases are also a great opportunity for other important things:

- Give some kudos to the author. You know how good it feels when someone else appreciates your work.
  Take the opportunity to make someone else feel good about their work, when it's deserved!
- Ask questions. Try to learn something new from the PR. If you see some kind of new pattern or
  technique that you haven't seen before, ask the author about it. This is a great way to learn new
  things and to show the author that you're interested in their work. And maybe you can ask them to
  host a session where they explain the new thing to the rest of the team!

In the vast majority of cases though, there's always something to comment on. If you're often
struggling to find things to say, you're probably not putting enough mental energy into the PR
review process.

When reading through the code, ask yourself:

- Is this code easy to understand? If not, why not?
- Would there be a better way to do this? If so, what is it?
- Is there some kind of edge case that hasn't been considered?
- Is there some other work that is affected by this PR that the author might have not considered?
- Is the PR even solving the right problem?

There's an endless amount of angles you can take to reviewing someone else's work. As you do more of
it, you'll get better at it, and you'll find it easier and easier to find things to comment on -
without even having to actively think about it.

# But I don't have time for this

Reviewing PRs takes time, but not as much as you might think. If you feel like you don't have time
for proper PR reviews, you're failing to realise that it's a core part of your job as a software
developer. It would be like saying that you don't have time to write tests, or to write
documentation (which would be a problem)!

For me, the key idea is to make PR reviews feel like a zero-time activity. What does this mean? It
means that you should learn to multi-thread your work. Aim to find a way to review PRs while you're
personally waiting for something else to happen. For example:

- You're waiting for a build to finish... review a PR!
- You're waiting for a meeting to start... review a PR!
- You just submitted a PR yourself... review someone else's PR while you're waiting!

If you stop and think about it, there's an endless amount of 15-minute gaps in your day where you
could be reviewing someone else's work.

# But the PRs are so large and complex

Now we're getting into the real meat of the problem. If a culture has been born where PRs are often
very large and complex, it's going to be a real struggle to get people to review them, and to get
any useful comments.

It's not your shortcoming if you're struggling to review a PR that's 5000 lines long and touches 30
different files. This is a failure of the author or the team to break down their work into smaller,
more manageable chunks.

As a team, you need to work together to break this cycle. Everyone needs to make it a priority to
make their own work as easy to review as possible. Going back to the first part of this post,
everyone should be submitting at least one PR a day, and they should be small and focused.

A good PR, as a rule of thumb, is something you can understand and review in under 10 minutes. If
not, the PR is too big.

When you come across such a PR, don't just accept it as it is. Tell the author that it's hard to
review, and ask them to split it up into smaller chunks. Eventually, everyone will realise that the
way to get their work merged the fastest is to put in a bit of extra effort to make it easy for
others to review.

# Wrapping up

The highest-performing teams I've been a part of have always been the ones where PR reviews are
considered as a top priority. In these kinds of teams, the first review for a PR often comes in
under an hour - and it's usually an approval because the PR was polished, small and focused to begin
with. A good PR review culture is the difference between teams that are shipping changes to
production every day, and teams that are struggling to get anything done.
