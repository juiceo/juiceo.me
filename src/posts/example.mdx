# How humans communicate

Let's ask the question: what is the most natural way for humans to communicate
with each other? The answer is, of course, language. It's how humans express
their thoughts and intentions to each other.

But, language is full of ambiguity and nuance. Language can be used to express
abstract ideas, vague intentions and complex emotions. Human communication is
often anything but just a series of precise and unambiguous commands and
instructions, but rather requires the listener to interpret the speaker's
meaning.

Unfortunately, machines don't understand abstract ideas or vague intentions -
they need the user to tell them exactly what to do. This has been the role of
user interfaces (or, "UIs"): bridging this communication gap by serving as a
translator of sorts, and allowing humans and machines to communicate with each
other.

# Machines don't understand language?

But wait, what if machines could understand human language? What if a user could
just "talk" to a machine and explain what they want to do - and the machine
would be able to understand and act on that?

Maybe you see where I'm going with this: I don't think the above statements are
necessarily true anymore. Since the release of ChatGPT (and other large language
models), I think it has been clear to see that machines can in fact understand
human language quite well.

These language models still have their faults and rough edges - but you need to
consider the speed of progress over the past few years. How much has ChatGPT
improved since the initial release in 2022? If the speed of progress stays the
same, how good will these models be in 2025? Or 2030?

# My predictions

I have a few predictions for the future (which is already now, by the way):

    - User interfaces will become *a lot* simpler
    - Frontend development will look very different
    - It will be easier to build complex applications

The rest of this post will be dedicated to explaining these predictions, and
what recent technological advances are making them possible (if not inevitable).

## User interfaces will become a lot simpler

## Frontend development will look very different

## It will be easier to build complex applications
