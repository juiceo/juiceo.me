Let's start with this: I love React. It just makes so much sense to me personally how it all works. I love the fact that it's _just Javascript_. I love the freedom you have when figuring out
how to design and arrange your components. In some strange way, I even love all of the footguns you have to understand and avoid.

But if you've been writing React for any amount of time, you'll probably agree that it's pretty hard to come up with a clear idea on how you should
actually structure your code. There's not one right way to do it. There's not really even a "React way" to do it - you can't find any official styleguide
or collection of best practices in the docs. React intentionally just leaves themselves out of this discussion and leaves it up to the user to figure out
what works for them.


Especially if you work in a team, it would be really nice if everyone had a shared idea of how to write React. It would be amazing if you could just open up any component and know exactly where to find everything you need - and when writing a component _intuitively_ know exactly where to put everything.
For the 8 or so years I've been working with React, I've spent an inordinate amount of time thinking about what the _perfect_ React component looks like. 
 

for any amount of time, you'll probably agree that it's not always easy to know what's the "right" way to do things. 

I often find myself thinking about what the _perfect_ React component looks like - purely from a code convention perspective I mean.
