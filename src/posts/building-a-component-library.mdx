# Why we built a component library

At [Twice](https://twicecommerce.com) we'd been talking about setting up a
component library pretty much as long as I've been there. It always seemed like
it would be a better way to organise ourselves around building UI components,
but as is often the case in startup land, it never quite made it to the top of
the priority list.

Finally last fall we came across a project where it felt like the best way to
approach it would be to build a component library: we were working on our Wix
integration and needed to split our existing online store into individually
embeddable building blocks that users could use to add bits and pieces of our
rental functionality to their existing Wix website. As the goal for the project
was to build a series of isolated components, instead of an app, building them
in something like Storybook seemed like the obvious choice.

Fast forward 6 or so months, and the whole team has transitioned to a workflow
of building UI components mostly in Storybook, in all of our projects. Overall
it's been a definite change for the better, but there have definitely been a
fair share of pitfalls along the way too.

So, below is my take on what we've learned along the way, what went well and
what we'd do differently if we were to do it all again!

# What we learned along the way

## It's easier to start alone

I worked mostly alone on the component library side during the Wix project,
while the rest of the team was working on different aspects of the project, or
different things entirely. In hindsight, this was critical to building a solid
foundation: I could quickly iterate on the structure as I noticed what worked
well and what didn't, instead of having to sync up with the rest of the team.

It's really important to have an opinionated structure in your component
library: you need to decide on a file structure, naming conventions, shared
props interfaces and other repeatable patterns that make it easier to build and
maintain for everyone. A component library without a clear set of rules will
inevitably turn into an incomprehensible mess as it grows and as the rest of the
team adopts it.

You will NOT get this right the first time - but instead if you're anything like
me you'll have almost daily a-ha moments where you realise that something you've
been doing doesn't really scale too well, and you want to refactor or take a
slightly different approach to many of the things you've built. The bigger the
library grows and the more people you have working on it, the harder it will be
to make these sorts of fundamental changes.

If I would've had to run every decision by the rest of the team, argument my
reasoning for why I want to restructure or refactor something, or worry about
breaking someone else's work when I change things, I think progress would have
been much slower and perhaps some of the valuable iteration cycles would have
been skipped. Of course it's good to remember that you're building something
that will be used by the entire team, so it's good to periodically ask for
feedback - but ultimately someone needs to make opinionated decisions as well.

So, here's the first piece of advice I would give: start with a small taskforce
(or even just one person), get the foundations right, and then slowly onboard
the rest of the team.

## Avoid hasty abstractions

I feel like one of the biggest pitfalls in programming is to start abstracting
things too early. I remember reading about the DRY principle ("Don't Repeat
Yourself") in my _first ever_ university programming course, and for a long time
I took it as some kind of sacred rule that should be followed at all costs.
Whenever some piece of logic, however small, was repeated - it should be moved
into a "reusable abstraction".

**But this is a trap**. What they don't tell you is that abstractions are always
a tradeoff: they make things more reusable, but they also introduce
dependencies, complexity and cognitive overhead. These days I am a follower of
the church of [AHA programming](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming)
("Avoid Hasty Abstractions"), which states that the best time to abstract
something is when the need is LITERALLY SCREAMING IN YOUR FACE.

Making the wrong abstraction too early starts a vicious cycle: the abstraction
isn't perfect, but it's used in a few places, so it's a bit of an effort to
change. You need to add a new feature or handle some edge case, and you don't
want to break any existing code, so you monkey patch it with some additional
logic. This goes on for a while, and before you know it you have a steaming pile
of spaghetti code that's used all over your application, that is too much work
or too big of a risk to start refactoring. Slowly your entire codebase becomes a
graveyard of half-baked abstractions and the most appealing way to move forward
is to start from scratch.

This is especially a real danger in a component library context, where _sort of
the whole point_ is to come up with useful abstractions for common problems.

What I would recommend is the following:

- Start by building components without any abstractions at all
- As you start noticing repeating patterns, RESIST the urge to build
  abstractions immediately
- When a common pattern is so obvious that it's literally hurting you to repeat
  it, build an abstraction for it

But remember - the goal is to make it easier for everyone to follow the shared
conventions, rules and patterns in the component library. The correct
abstractions can help with this. The wrong abstractions will make it harder.

## Start small (and stay small)

It's typical for design systems to split components into a few different
categories. One common grouping is something like:

- "Atoms" - the smallest building blocks like buttons, inputs, etc.
- "Molecules" - a combination of atoms, like a form field
- "Organisms" - a combination of molecules, like a form
- "Templates" - a combination of organisms, like a page layout
- etc.

An intuitive approach would be to start building this sort of structure into
your component library as well - especially if you already have a design system
with something like the above.

My honest recommendation: ditch all of that. Don't even try to start figuring
out which components go in which category. Despite your best efforts, you'll end
up with a bunch of components that don't fit neatly into any of these
categories. The end result will be that you'll have a so-so structure in place,
which is causing more confusion than it's solving.

The other reason I'd recommend avoiding these sorts of categorisations, is that
as you move up in this hierarchy, building good generic abstractions becomes
REALLY HARD. When you start to build things like page layouts or entire forms,
you'll easily find yourself actually embedding a lot of application logic and
context into your component library. Remember: the goal isn't to just move all
of your frontend code under this new project - application logic still belongs
in applications, not in your component library.

So my tip here is: just focus on building the smallest possible (useful)
components - we can call them "atoms" for example. This doesn't mean you need to
focus on building just visually small components like individual buttons or
inputs, but rather "logically small" components:

- They have a clear GENERIC purpose: it is obvious what they do and how they
  should be used, even for someone who doesn't know anything about the
  applications you're building
- They have a clear API: they don't have a million different props and ways to
  make them do different things
- They don't contain application logic: they don't know anything about the
  application state or how they will be used in a specific context

Leave it to the consuming applications to combine these and build application
logic. This way you'll more likely avoid the perilous path of building bad
abstractions into your component library.

## Documentation as a priority

In some strange way, I've always enjoyed writing documentation comments in
code - it's somehow very satisfying to write really neat JSDoc comments for
example, even if the code itself would be quite self explanatory. But it's
always been a sort of extra thing and not something that I've ever considered
any kind of requirement.

In the context of a component library however, good documentation is absolutely
vital. There's I think two reasons for that, and I'll start with the less
important one.

### Docs pages!

In many component library frameworks (at least this is the case in Storybook)
your documentation pages are automatically generated based on the comments you
write in your code. Consider the difference between these two examples:

![The "FilterTabs" component with documentation](/images/filtertabs-docs.png)
![And without documentation](/images/filtertabs-nodocs.png)

Luckily in the second example, despite not having JSDoc comments, we still have
the luxury of being able to see the TypeScript types for the component props -
but maybe you can see how something as simple as spending 1 minute to (have
GitHub Copilot) write some JSDoc comments can make a big difference in how easy
it is to understand what a component does.

### The more important reason

This is nice and all, but it's not the real reason why documentation is so
important. The REAL reason is that _it's really hard to write documentation for
something that violates the principle of keeping to "logically small" components
from above._

**A component doesn't have a clear, generic purpose?** It's hard to write a good
explanation of what it is and what it does (or in many cases even give it a
name).

**A component takes in a million different props and has tons of ways to make it
do different things?** Good luck describing all of those.

**A component requires knowledge of some application-specific context to
understand?** Hopefully while writing the comment that explains this, you'll
remember that you weren't supposed to do that!

Any time you find yourself struggling to write documentation comments that make
sense (or especially if you find GitHub Copilot struggling), it's a good sign
that what you're building doesn't make that much sense. If I have a skim through
our component library, there is a very large overlap in the Venn diagram of a)
components that I don't think are abstracted very well and b) components that
are missing documentation.

My advice: always write thorough documentation for your components. This will
help you avoid building the wrong ones.

## Leverage your existing UI library / theme

If you're building a component library in a project that already has a UI
library (for example, MUI) in use, you don't need to (and shouldn't) build your
own abstractions over the basic components in the UI library: things like
buttons, inputs and so on.

It's much better if you just use those components directly from the UI library.
If you need to customize the appearance of those base components, you can do
that by customizing your theme setup instead of filling our own library with
components that are just very light wrappers around the UI library components.

## Benchmark with pride

Speaking of UI libraries, it's a good idea to benchmark your favorite open
source UI library in a lot of things. Some examples of things we've looked at:

- How do they arrange their docs?
- What kinds of demos do they have for their components?
- What kinds of prop naming conventions do they use?
- How do components that extend other components work?

Authors of popular component libraries have no doubt spent tons of time & effort
debating and deciding on these sorts of details, so it's probably a pretty good
idea to just copy some patterns from them - or at least have a look at what they
are doing.

We've certainly benchmarked and/or directly copied a lot of things from MUI,
especially with regards to how components are structured, how different kinds of
props are named and how components can be composed together.

# Closing thoughts

Over the past 6 months, I've been spending an increasing amount of my time
working in our component library instead of developing directly in our
applications. Personally I love the workflow, and I think it has led to a pretty
significant increase in the quality of the UI components we're building. If you
haven't yet opened the door to this way of working, hopefully this post sparks
some inspiration to give it a try!
