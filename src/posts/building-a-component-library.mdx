# Why we built a component library

At [Twice](https://twicecommerce.com) we'd been talking about setting up a
component library pretty much as long as I've been there. It always seemed like
it would be a better way to organise ourselves around building UI components,
but as is often the case in startup land, it never quite made it to the top of
the priority list.

Finally last fall we came across a project where it felt like the best way to
approach it would be to build a component library: we were working on our Wix
integration and needed to split our existing online store into individually
embeddable building blocks that users could use to add our rental functionality
to their existing Wix website.

As the tool of choice we landed on Storybook, and started building our component
library from scratch. After the Wix project, we onboarded the rest of the team
to the "component library workflow" and have been building most of our UI
components there since.

Overall it's been a definite change for the better, but of course it hasn't been
a journey without it's pitfalls. Here's a few of my recommendations for what to
do, and what to avoid if you want to tackle a similar project.

# What we learned along the way

## It's easier to start alone

I worked mostly alone on the component library side during the Wix project,
while the rest of the team was working on different aspects of the project, or
different things entirely. In hindsight, this was critical to building a solid
foundation: I could quickly iterate on the structure as I noticed what worked
well and what didn't, instead of having to sync up with the rest of the team.

It's really important to have an opinionated structure in your component
library: you need to decide on a file structure, naming conventions, shared
props interfaces and other repeatable patterns that make it easier to build and
maintain for everyone. A component library without a clear set of rules will
inevitably turn into an incomprehensible mess as it grows and as the rest of the
team adopts it.

You will NOT get this right the first time - but instead if you're anything like
me you'll have almost daily a-ha moments where you realise that something you've
been doing doesn't really scale too well, and you want to refactor everything
you've built. The bigger the library grows and the more people you have working
on it, the harder it will be to make these sorts of fundamental changes.

If I would've had to run every decision by the rest of the team, argument my
reasoning for why I want to restructure or refactor something, or worry about
breaking someone else's work when I change things, I think progress would have
been much slower and perhaps some of the valuable iteration cycles would have
been skipped. Of course it's good to remember that you're building something
that will be used by the entire team, so it's good to periodically ask for
feedback - but ultimately someone needs to make opinionated decisions as well.

So, learning number one: start with a small team (or alone), get the foundations
right, and then slowly onboard the rest of the team.

## Avoid hasty abstractions

I feel like one of the biggest pitfalls in programming is to start abstracting
things too early. I remember reading about the DRY principle ("Don't Repeat
Yourself") in my _first ever_ university programming course, and for a long time
I took it as some kind of sacred rule that should be followed at all costs.
Whenever some piece of logic, however small, was repeated - it should be moved
into a "reusable abstraction".

But WAIT! **This is a trap**. What they don't tell you is that abstractions are
always a tradeoff: they make things more reusable, but they also introduce
dependencies, complexity and cognitive overhead. These days I am a follower of
the church of [AHA programming](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming)
("Avoid Hasty Abstractions"), which states that the best time to abstract
something is when the need is LITERALLY SCREAMING IN YOUR FACE.

Making the wrong abstraction too early starts a vicious cycle: the abstraction
isn't perfect, but it's used in a few places, so it's a bit of an effort to
change. You need to add a new feature or handle some edge case, and you don't
want to break any existing code, so you monkey patch it with some additional
logic. This goes on for a while, and before you know it you have a steaming pile
of spaghetti code that's used all over your application, that is too much work
or too big of a risk to start refactoring. Slowly your entire codebase becomes a
graveyard of half-baked abstractions and the most appealing way to move forward
is to start from scratch.

This is especially a real danger in a component library context, where _sort of
the whole point_ is to come up with useful abstractions for common problems.

What I would recommend is the following:

- Start by building components without any abstractions at all
- As you start noticing repeating patterns, RESIST the urge to build
  abstractions immediately
- When a common pattern is so obvious that it's literally hurting you to repeat
  it, build an abstraction for it

But remember - the goal is to make it easier for everyone to follow the shared
conventions, rules and patterns in the component library. The correct
abstractions can help with this. The wrong abstractions will make it harder.

One useful abstraction we've built is a wrapper HOC (higher order component) for
all components in the library. The current naming of it isn't ideal, but if I
would name it again it would be called `component` - and the usage is like so:

```tsx

import { component } from '@twice/ui'


const MyComponent = component((props: MyComponentProps) => {
    return ( ... )
})
```

The `component` HOC does a few things:

- It adds some shared props to all components: `$sx` for adding inline styles to
  the wrapper element, `$theme` for customizing the theme of the component and
  `$localization` for overriding the localization of the component
- It makes sure that all of the necessary context providers are rendered above
  the component, if they are not existing higher up in the tree.

What makes this a useful abstraction in my opinion:

- It's dead simple to use: you just wrap your component in it.
- It establishes a shared pattern for a common problem - making sure all
  components are styleable and themeable without having to figure out the props
  interface & logic separately for each component
